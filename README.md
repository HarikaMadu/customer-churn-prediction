What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using company's product or service during a certain time frame. Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate as it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Customer churn is extremley costly for companies. Based on a churn rate just under two percent for top companies, one source estimates carriers lose $65 million per month from churn. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies should predict which customers are highly prone to churn.

Individualized customer retention is demanding because most companies have a large number of customers and cannot afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue.
